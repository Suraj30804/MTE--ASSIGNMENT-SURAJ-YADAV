# üî¢ 40. Find the Element with Maximum Frequency in an Array

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the element with the maximum frequency in the array. If there are multiple elements with the same frequency, return the element that appears first in the array.

## üß† Algorithm

### Approach:
1. **Use a Hash Map**: A hash map (or dictionary) is a perfect data structure to store and count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. **Traverse the Array**: Traverse through the array and update the frequency of each element in the hash map.
3. **Track Maximum Frequency**: While traversing, keep track of the element with the maximum frequency.
4. **Handle Ties**: If there are multiple elements with the same frequency, the element that appears first in the array should be returned.

### Steps:
1. Create a hash map (or dictionary) to store the frequency of each element.
2. Traverse the array and update the frequency of each element in the hash map.
3. Initialize variables to store the element with the maximum frequency and its count.
4. Traverse through the hash map and identify the element with the highest frequency.
5. Return the element with the maximum frequency.

## üíª Java Program

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaxFrequencyElement {
    public static int findMaxFrequencyElement(int[] arr) {
        // Step 1: Create a hash map to store the frequency of each element
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Step 2: Traverse the array and populate the frequency map
        for (int num : arr) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Step 3: Track the element with the maximum frequency
        int maxElement = arr[0];
        int maxFrequency = 1;
        
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : frequencyMap.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() > maxFrequency) {
                maxElement = entry.getKey();
                maxFrequency = entry.getValue();
            }
        }
        
        return maxElement;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 4};
        System.out.println("Element with maximum frequency: " + findMaxFrequencyElement(arr));
    }
}
```

## üß™ Example

### Input:
```
arr = [1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 4]
```

### Output:
```
Element with maximum frequency: 3
```

### Explanation:
- The frequency of elements:
  - `1` appears 2 times
  - `3` appears 3 times
  - `2` appears 1 time
  - `4` appears 1 time
- The element with the maximum frequency is `3`, which appears 3 times.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexities

| Metric              | Complexity         |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Time Complexity**  | O(n)               |
| **Space Complexity** | O(n)               |

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm makes two passes over the array:
  1. The first pass fills the frequency map, which takes `O(n)` time.
  2. The second pass goes through the frequency map to find the element with the highest frequency, which takes `O(n)` time in the worst case (since there are at most `n` unique elements).
  
  Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the use of a hash map to store the frequency of each element. In the worst case, the array could have `n` unique elements.

---

## üìå Summary

This approach efficiently finds the element with the maximum frequency in the array using a **hash map**. The time complexity is linear (`O(n)`) due to the two passes over the array, and the space complexity is also linear (`O(n)`) due to the hash map storage.

This technique is widely used in problems involving frequency counting and is useful for problems where order matters or when there are multiple elements with the same frequency.
