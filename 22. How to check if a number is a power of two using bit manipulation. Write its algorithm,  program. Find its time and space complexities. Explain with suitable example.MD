# üî¢ How to Check if a Number is a Power of Two Using Bit Manipulation

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, determine if it is a power of two using **bit manipulation**. A number is a power of two if it can be expressed as \(2^k\), where `k` is a non-negative integer.

For example:
- `1` is a power of two: \(2^0\)
- `2` is a power of two: \(2^1\)
- `4` is a power of two: \(2^2\)
- `8` is a power of two: \(2^3\)
- `16` is a power of two: \(2^4\)

## üß† Algorithm (Bit Manipulation)

### Key Insight:
A number is a power of two if and only if it has exactly one `1` bit in its binary representation. This property can be checked using the following trick:

- **For a number `n` to be a power of two**: The expression `n & (n - 1)` should be equal to `0` **and** `n` must be greater than `0`.

  - `n & (n - 1)` clears the lowest set bit of `n`, and if the result is `0`, it means that `n` has only one `1` bit in its binary representation.
  
### Steps:
1. **Check if `n` is greater than `0`**: If `n <= 0`, then it cannot be a power of two.
2. **Apply the bit manipulation trick**: Check if `n & (n - 1) == 0`. If true, then `n` is a power of two.
3. **Return the result**: Return `true` if `n` is a power of two, otherwise `false`.

## üíª Java Program

```java
public class PowerOfTwo {

    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // A number is a power of two if it is greater than 0 and n & (n - 1) == 0
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 16;
        System.out.println("Is " + n + " a power of two? " + isPowerOfTwo(n));
    }
}
```

---

## üìå Example

### Input:
```
n = 16
```

### Process:
1. **Check if `n > 0`**: Since `n = 16`, it is greater than `0`, so we proceed to the next step.
2. **Apply the bit manipulation trick**: 
   - `n = 16`, so `n - 1 = 15`.
   - `n & (n - 1)` becomes:
     ```
     16 (binary: 10000)
     & 15 (binary: 01111)
     ---------------
     0 (binary: 00000)
     ```
   - Since the result is `0`, `n` is a power of two.
3. **Return the result**: The function returns `true`.

### ‚úÖ Output:
```
Is 16 a power of two? true
```

### Input:
```
n = 18
```

### Process:
1. **Check if `n > 0`**: Since `n = 18`, it is greater than `0`, so we proceed.
2. **Apply the bit manipulation trick**: 
   - `n = 18`, so `n - 1 = 17`.
   - `n & (n - 1)` becomes:
     ```
     18 (binary: 10010)
     & 17 (binary: 10001)
     ---------------
     16 (binary: 10000)
     ```
   - Since the result is not `0`, `n` is **not** a power of two.
3. **Return the result**: The function returns `false`.

### ‚úÖ Output:
```
Is 18 a power of two? false
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

| Operation            | Complexity     |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Time                 | O(1)           |
| Space                | O(1)           |

- **Time Complexity:** O(1), as the bitwise operations `n & (n - 1)` and the comparison are done in constant time.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for the variables.

## üìö Summary

The problem of checking if a number is a power of two can be efficiently solved using **bit manipulation**. The key insight is that a power of two has exactly one `1` bit in its binary representation, and the expression `n & (n - 1)` helps verify this property in constant time, O(1). This solution is optimal with respect to both time and space complexity.
