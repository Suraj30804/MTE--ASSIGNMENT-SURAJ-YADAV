# 🔢 Find the Next Greater Element for Each Element in an Array

## ✅ Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, for each element in the array, find the **next greater element** (NGE) to the right of it. The next greater element for an element `x` is the first element to the right of `x` that is **greater** than `x`. If there is no greater element to the right, assign `-1` to that element.

For example:
- Input: `[4, 5, 2, 10, 8]`
- Output: `[5, 10, 10, -1, -1]`
  
### Explanation:
- For `4`, the next greater element is `5`.
- For `5`, the next greater element is `10`.
- For `2`, the next greater element is `10`.
- For `10`, there is no greater element, so it is `-1`.
- For `8`, there is no greater element, so it is `-1`.

## 🧠 Algorithm

### Optimized Approach Using a Stack:

1. **Use a Stack to Track Elements**:
   - Traverse the array from right to left.
   - Use the stack to keep track of the elements in decreasing order. This way, the next greater element for any element will always be at the top of the stack.
   
2. **For each element**:
   - While the stack is not empty and the element at the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current element, pop elements from the stack (because they cannot be the next greater element for the current element).
   - If the stack is not empty after popping, the element at the top of the stack is the next greater element.
   - If the stack is empty, there is no greater element, so set `-1` for that element.
   - Push the current element onto the stack.

3. **Result**:
   - After processing all elements, the `nextGreater` array will contain the next greater element for each index.

## 💻 Java Program

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class NextGreaterElement {

    // Function to find the next greater element for each element in the array
    public static int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        // Initialize the result array with -1 (default value)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result[i] = -1;
        }
        
        // Traverse the array from right to left
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() <= nums[i]) {
                stack.pop();  // Pop elements smaller than or equal to nums[i]
            }
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                result[i] = stack.peek();  // The next greater element
            }
            stack.push(nums[i]);  // Push the current element onto the stack
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {4, 5, 2, 10, 8};
        int[] result = nextGreaterElements(nums);
        
        System.out.print("Next Greater Elements: ");
        for (int n : result) {
            System.out.print(n + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

## 📌 Example

### Input:
```
nums = [4, 5, 2, 10, 8]
```

### Process:

1. **Initialize the result array** as `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`.
2. Traverse the array from left to right:
   - For `4`, the next greater element is `5` (push `5` onto the stack).
   - For `5`, the next greater element is `10` (push `10` onto the stack).
   - For `2`, the next greater element is `10` (push `10` onto the stack).
   - For `10`, there is no greater element, so it remains `-1`.
   - For `8`, there is no greater element, so it remains `-1`.

### ✅ Output:
```
Next Greater Elements: 5 10 10 -1 -1
```

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Operation            | Complexity     |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Time Complexity      | O(n)           |
| Space Complexity     | O(n)           |

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, so the overall time complexity is O(n).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), because the stack stores up to `n` elements in the worst case, and we also use an array `result` of size `n`.

## 📚 Summary

The problem of finding the next greater element for each element in an array can be solved efficiently using a **stack**. By iterating through the array from right to left and utilizing the stack to track the elements, we can find the next greater element in **O(n)** time. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it ideal for solving problems where comparisons between elements need to be made dynamically as we traverse the array.
