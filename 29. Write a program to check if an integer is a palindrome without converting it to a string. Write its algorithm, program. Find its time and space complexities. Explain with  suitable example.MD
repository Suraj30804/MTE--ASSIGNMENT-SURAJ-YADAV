# 🔁 29. Check if an Integer is a Palindrome (Without Using String Conversion)

## ✅ Problem Statement

Write a program to check whether a given integer is a palindrome **without converting it into a string**.

A **palindromic number** is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Negative numbers are **not** palindromes.
2. If the number ends with a `0` (but is not 0), it's **not** a palindrome.
3. Reverse the second half of the number and compare with the first half.
4. Stop reversing once the reversed half is greater than or equal to the remaining original number.

### Steps:
- Initialize `reversed = 0`
- Loop while `x > reversed`:
  - `reversed = reversed * 10 + x % 10`
  - `x = x / 10`
- After loop, check:
  - `x == reversed` for even-length numbers
  - `x == reversed / 10` for odd-length numbers

---

## 💻 Java Program

```java
public class PalindromeNumber {

    public static boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        // Negative numbers are not palindrome
        if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) return false;

        int reversed = 0;
        while (x > reversed) {
            reversed = reversed * 10 + x % 10;
            x = x / 10;
        }

        // Check for even and odd digit numbers
        return (x == reversed || x == reversed / 10);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 121;
        int num2 = 123;

        System.out.println(num1 + " is palindrome? " + isPalindrome(num1)); // true
        System.out.println(num2 + " is palindrome? " + isPalindrome(num2)); // false
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Example

### Input:
```
x = 1221
```

### Process:
```
Reversed half: 1 → 12
Remaining x: 12
Match: Yes (even length)
```

### Output:
```
True
```

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexities

| Complexity | Value  |
|------------|--------|
| Time       | O(log₁₀N) → digits of number |
| Space      | O(1)   |

- **Time**: Proportional to number of digits (each divided by 10).
- **Space**: No additional space used.

---

## 📌 Summary

This efficient approach avoids string conversion by **mathematically reversing** half of the number, saving both time and space, and handling edge cases like negative numbers and trailing zeros.
