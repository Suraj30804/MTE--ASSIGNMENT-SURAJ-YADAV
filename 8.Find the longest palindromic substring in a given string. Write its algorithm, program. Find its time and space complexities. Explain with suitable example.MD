# 🔁 Longest Palindromic Substring

## ✅ Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the **longest substring** that is a **palindrome** (reads the same forward and backward).

---

## 🧠 Algorithm (Expand Around Center)

A palindrome mirrors around its center. So the idea is to:

1. Consider each character (and pair of characters) as the **center** of a possible palindrome.
2. Expand around that center as long as the characters on both sides match.
3. Track the **longest** palindrome found.

We check for:
- Odd-length palindromes: center at `i`
- Even-length palindromes: center between `i` and `i+1`

## 💻 Java Program

```java
public class LongestPalindromicSubstring {

    public static String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() < 1) return "";

        int start = 0, end = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);       // odd length
            int len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);   // even length
            int len = Math.max(len1, len2);

            if (len > (end - start)) {
                start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
                end = i + len / 2;
            }
        }

        return s.substring(start, end + 1);
    }

    private static int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return right - left - 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "babad";
        String result = longestPalindrome(input);
        System.out.println("Longest palindromic substring: " + result);
    }
}
```

---

## 📌 Example

### Input:
```
s = "babad"
```

### Possible Palindromes:
- "bab" (centered at 1)
- "aba" (centered at 2)

Both have length 3 — we can return either.

### ✅ Output:
```
Longest palindromic substring: "bab" (or "aba")
```

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Operation               | Complexity |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Time                    | O(n²)      |
| Space                   | O(1)       |

- We expand around every center, which gives us O(n²) time.
- No extra space is used apart from variables.

---

## 📚 Summary

- This method is very efficient and simple to implement.
- Handles both even and odd length palindromes.
- More efficient than brute-force (which checks all substrings).
