# 🔗 Find the Node Where Two Singly Linked Lists Intersect

## ✅ Problem Statement

Given the heads of two singly linked lists, determine the node at which the two lists intersect. If there is no intersection, return `null`.

**Constraints:**
- The two linked lists must retain their original structure.
- You may assume there are no cycles in the linked lists.

### Example:
```
List A: 1 → 2 → 3 \
                   → 6 → 7
List B:       4 → 5 /
Intersection at node with value: 6
```

## 🧠 Algorithm (Two Pointers Technique)

1. Initialize two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, to the heads of List A and List B respectively.
2. Traverse both lists:
   - When a pointer reaches the end of its list, redirect it to the head of the other list.
   - Continue until the two pointers meet or both become `null`.
3. If the lists intersect, `p1` and `p2` will eventually meet at the intersection node.
4. If not, both will become `null` at the end.

### Why It Works:
- Switching heads equalizes the path lengths traversed.
- Each pointer travels the sum of both lists’ lengths before potentially meeting.

## 💻 Java Program

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) {
        val = x;
        next = null;
    }
}

public class IntersectionNode {

    public static ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode p1 = headA;
        ListNode p2 = headB;
        
        while (p1 != p2) {
            p1 = (p1 == null) ? headB : p1.next;
            p2 = (p2 == null) ? headA : p2.next;
        }

        return p1; // Will be null if no intersection
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating intersection node
        ListNode intersect = new ListNode(6);
        intersect.next = new ListNode(7);

        // List A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7
        ListNode headA = new ListNode(1);
        headA.next = new ListNode(2);
        headA.next.next = new ListNode(3);
        headA.next.next.next = intersect;

        // List B: 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
        ListNode headB = new ListNode(4);
        headB.next = new ListNode(5);
        headB.next.next = intersect;

        ListNode result = getIntersectionNode(headA, headB);
        if (result != null)
            System.out.println("Intersection at node: " + result.val);
        else
            System.out.println("No intersection.");
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

### Input:
```
List A: 1 → 2 → 3 → 6 → 7  
List B:       4 → 5 → 6 → 7
```

### Output:
```
Intersection at node: 6
```

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexities

| Complexity | Value  |
|------------|--------|
| Time       | O(m + n) |
| Space      | O(1)   |

- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two lists.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only two pointers are used.

## 📌 Summary

The two-pointer technique provides an elegant and efficient way to solve the intersection problem **without modifying the original structure** of the linked lists and **using constant space**. If the two lists intersect, the pointers will sync up at the intersection node; if not, both will reach `null` at the same time.
