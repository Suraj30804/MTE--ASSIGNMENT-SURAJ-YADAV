# ðŸ“š Algorithmic Assignment: 50 Classic Problems

Welcome to my repository for the **50 classic algorithmic problems**. This repository contains solutions for some of the most widely asked algorithm problems with explanations, code (in Java), and time/space complexity analysis. The solutions are accompanied by example inputs and outputs to help you understand the approach and application of each algorithm.
