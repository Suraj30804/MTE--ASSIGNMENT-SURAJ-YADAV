# üî¢ 36. Generate All Subsets of a Given Array

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return **all possible subsets** (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

---

## üß† Algorithm

### Key Idea:
- The problem is about generating the **power set** of an array. For each element, we have two choices:
  1. Include the element in the subset.
  2. Exclude the element from the subset.
- We can use **backtracking** or **bitwise representation** to generate all subsets.

### Approach:
- Start with an empty subset, and at each step, decide whether to include the current element or not.
- This can be done using **backtracking** to explore all combinations of including or excluding elements.

---

### Steps (Backtracking):
1. Start with an empty subset.
2. For each element:
   - Include the element and recursively find subsets.
   - Exclude the element and recursively find subsets.
3. Store all subsets generated.

## üíª Java Program

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Subsets {
    public static List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(nums, 0, new ArrayList<>(), result);
        return result;
    }

    private static void backtrack(int[] nums, int index, List<Integer> current, List<List<Integer>> result) {
        // Add the current subset to the result
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));

        // Explore subsets with each element starting from the current index
        for (int i = index; i < nums.length; i++) {
            current.add(nums[i]);
            backtrack(nums, i + 1, current, result);  // Include nums[i]
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);       // Exclude nums[i]
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        List<List<Integer>> subsets = subsets(nums);
        System.out.println(subsets);
    }
}
```

## üß™ Example

### Input:
```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
```

### Output:
```
[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
```

### Explanation:
- All possible subsets of `[1, 2, 3]` are:
  - `[]` (empty subset)
  - `[1]`
  - `[1, 2]`
  - `[1, 2, 3]`
  - `[1, 3]`
  - `[2]`
  - `[2, 3]`
  - `[3]`

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexities

| Metric              | Complexity         |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Time               | O(2^n)             |
| Space              | O(2^n)             |

- **Time Complexity**: There are `2^n` possible subsets, and for each subset, we add it to the result.
- **Space Complexity**: The space required to store all subsets is proportional to `2^n`.

---

## üìå Summary

The **backtracking** approach generates all subsets by considering both the inclusion and exclusion of each element in the array. This method is efficient for solving **power set problems** and can be adapted for other combinations-based problems.

This technique is commonly used in:
- Generating combinations and permutations
- Solving problems where multiple possibilities need to be explored
