# 🏗️ 32. Largest Rectangle in a Histogram

## ✅ Problem Statement

Given an array representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the **area of the largest rectangle** that can be formed.

Each bar has a width of 1.

## 🧠 Algorithm (Using Stack)

### Key Idea:
Use a **stack** to keep track of bars' indices in **non-decreasing order**.  
When a smaller height is found, calculate area for all taller bars that are now bounded.

---

### Steps:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a variable `maxArea = 0`.
2. Traverse the heights array:
   - While the current bar is **less than the top of the stack**:
     - Pop from the stack.
     - Compute the area: `height * width`  
       where `width = current index - index of new top - 1`.
     - Update `maxArea`.
   - Push current index to stack.
3. After iteration, process remaining bars in the stack similarly.

## 💻 Java Program

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class LargestRectangleHistogram {
    public static int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int maxArea = 0;
        int n = heights.length;

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            int currHeight = (i == n) ? 0 : heights[i];
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && currHeight < heights[stack.peek()]) {
                int height = heights[stack.pop()];
                int width = stack.isEmpty() ? i : i - stack.peek() - 1;
                maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, height * width);
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }

        return maxArea;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] histogram = {2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3};
        System.out.println("Largest Rectangle Area: " + largestRectangleArea(histogram));
    }
}
```

---

## 🧪 Example

### Input:
```
heights = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
```

### Output:
```
10
```

### Explanation:
- The largest rectangle is between heights 5 and 6 → Area = 5 × 2 = 10.

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexities

| Operation        | Complexity |
|------------------|------------|
| Time             | O(n)       |
| Space (stack)    | O(n)       |

- Each bar is **pushed and popped** from the stack at most once → O(n) time.

## 📌 Summary

The stack-based method is a powerful technique for solving this problem efficiently, by maintaining a **monotonic stack** and calculating areas dynamically.

It is widely used in solving **range-based problems** in 1D arrays efficiently.
