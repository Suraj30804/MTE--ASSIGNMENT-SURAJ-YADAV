## ✅ What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in **nodes**, and each node points to the **next** node in the sequence.

Unlike arrays, **linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations**. Instead, each node contains:
- **Data**
- **Reference (pointer) to the next node**

## 📦 Types of Linked Lists

1. **Singly Linked List**  
   Each node points to the next node.
   ```
   [1] → [2] → [3] → null
   ```

2. **Doubly Linked List**  
   Each node points to both next and previous nodes.
   ```
   null ← [1] ↔ [2] ↔ [3] → null
   ```

3. **Circular Linked List**  
   Last node points back to the first node.
   ```
   [1] → [2] → [3] ┐
     ↑            ↓
     └────────────┘
   ```

## 🧠 Why Use Linked Lists?

### ✅ Pros:
- **Dynamic size**: Grows/shrinks easily without reallocation.
- **Efficient insertion/deletion**: Especially at the beginning or middle.
- **Better for memory utilization** when data needs to be frequently updated.

### ❌ Cons:
- **No random access** (unlike arrays).
- **Extra memory** for pointers.
- Traversing is slower (`O(n)` to find an element).

## 💻 Linked List Node (Java)

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int d) {
        data = d;
        next = null;
    }
}
```

## ⚙️ Applications in Algorithm Design

1. **Stacks and Queues**  
   - Implemented using linked lists for dynamic behavior.

2. **Graph Adjacency Lists**  
   - Graphs use linked lists to represent neighbor nodes.

3. **Memory Management (Free List)**  
   - OS-level memory allocation uses linked lists to track free blocks.

4. **Polynomial Arithmetic**  
   - Storing polynomial terms as linked list nodes.

5. **Hash Tables with Chaining**  
   - Handle collisions using linked lists in buckets.

6. **Undo Functionality in Editors**  
   - Each state can be a node, linked to previous and next.

7. **Browser History Navigation**  
   - Implemented via a doubly linked list.

## ⏱️ Time Complexities

| Operation        | Linked List | Array    |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| Access (by index)| O(n)        | O(1)     |
| Insertion (start)| O(1)        | O(n)     |
| Insertion (end)  | O(1)\*      | O(n)     |
| Deletion         | O(1)\*      | O(n)     |

\* If pointer/reference to node is available.

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

**Problem:** Remove the N-th node from the end of a list.  
**Solution:** Use two-pointer technique in a singly linked list efficiently.

---

## 📌 Summary

Linked lists are foundational structures that offer **flexibility and dynamic memory usage**, making them a crucial choice in **algorithm design**, especially for problems involving dynamic data, frequent insertions, or deletions.
