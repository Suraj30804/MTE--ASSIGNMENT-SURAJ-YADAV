## ✅ What is the Sliding Window Technique?

The **Sliding Window** technique is an optimization method used for problems involving **linear data structures** like arrays or strings.

It involves creating a **window (subarray)** which slides across the data to examine different portions, avoiding unnecessary repeated computations.

---

## 🔍 Why Use Sliding Window?

Instead of recalculating the sum or other metrics for every subarray, sliding window allows:
- Faster computation
- Reduced time complexity
- Better space optimization

---

## 🧠 Types of Sliding Window

### 1. **Fixed-size window**
- Size `k` remains constant.
- Used in problems like:  
  - Maximum/minimum sum of subarrays of size k  
  - First negative number in every window of size k

### 2. **Dynamic-size window**
- Size varies depending on condition.
- Used in problems like:  
  - Longest substring without repeating characters  
  - Smallest subarray with sum ≥ target

## ⚙️ Example 1: Fixed Size Window – Max Sum of Subarray Size K

### Input:
```java
arr = [1, 4, 2, 10, 23, 3, 1, 0, 20], k = 4
```

### Output:
```
Max Sum = 39
```

### Idea:
1. Compute sum of first `k` elements.
2. Slide window by 1: subtract outgoing, add incoming.

### Code (Java):
```java
public int maxSum(int[] arr, int k) {
    int maxSum = 0, windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) windowSum += arr[i];
    maxSum = windowSum;

    for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
        windowSum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

## ⚙️ Example 2: Dynamic Size Window – Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

### Input:
```
s = "abcabcbb"
```

### Output:
```
Longest length = 3 ("abc")
```

### Code Idea:
Use a HashSet to store characters in the window. Adjust window dynamically to remove duplicates.

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexities

| Technique          | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Fixed-size window | O(n)             | O(1)             |
| Dynamic-size      | O(n)             | O(n)             |

## 💡 Common Applications

| Problem Type                             | Window Type    |
|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Maximum/Minimum sum of size k            | Fixed          |
| First/Last occurrence in window          | Fixed          |
| Longest substring with/without condition | Dynamic        |
| Subarray with given sum                  | Dynamic        |
| Sliding max/min using deque              | Fixed          |

## 📌 Summary

The **Sliding Window Technique** is a powerful tool to optimize **brute force solutions** in array and string problems.

It is especially useful when:
- You are dealing with **contiguous subarrays or substrings**
- The **problem requires optimization** over ranges or windows

This technique improves performance from **O(n²)** to **O(n)** in many classic problems.
