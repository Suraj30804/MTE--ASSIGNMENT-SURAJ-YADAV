# üî¢ 37. Find All Unique Combinations of Numbers that Sum to a Target

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

Given an array of **distinct integers** and a target number, return all **unique combinations** of numbers that sum to the target. Each number in the array can be used multiple times in the combination.

## üß† Algorithm

### Key Idea:
1. The problem is a **combination sum** problem where we are looking for all possible combinations of numbers that sum up to a target.
2. We can use **backtracking** to explore all possible combinations of numbers.
3. The idea is to explore each element, and recursively try to form combinations that sum to the target.

### Approach:
1. Sort the array (to handle duplicates and stop early if a number exceeds the target).
2. Use **backtracking** to try combinations by starting from the current index and repeating elements if necessary.
3. If the target becomes 0, store the current combination.

---

### Steps (Backtracking):
1. Start with an empty combination.
2. At each step, try adding the current element to the combination.
3. If the sum exceeds the target, backtrack.
4. If the sum equals the target, add the combination to the result.
5. Continue until all combinations are explored.

## üíª Java Program

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CombinationSum {
    public static List<List<Integer>> combinationSum(int[] candidates, int target) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(candidates);  // Optional: Sort to improve efficiency in pruning
        backtrack(candidates, target, 0, new ArrayList<>(), result);
        return result;
    }

    private static void backtrack(int[] candidates, int target, int start, List<Integer> current, List<List<Integer>> result) {
        // If we reach the target, add the current combination to the result
        if (target == 0) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
            return;
        }

        // Explore all elements starting from index 'start'
        for (int i = start; i < candidates.length; i++) {
            if (candidates[i] > target) break;  // Stop if the current number exceeds the target
            current.add(candidates[i]);
            // Recur with updated target and start index (same start index allows repetition of elements)
            backtrack(candidates, target - candidates[i], i, current, result);
            // Backtrack by removing the last added element
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] candidates = {2, 3, 6, 7};
        int target = 7;
        List<List<Integer>> combinations = combinationSum(candidates, target);
        System.out.println(combinations);
    }
}
```

## üß™ Example

### Input:
```
candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7], target = 7
```

### Output:
```
[[2, 2, 3], [7]]
```

### Explanation:
- The two unique combinations that sum to `7` are:
  - `[2, 2, 3]`
  - `[7]`

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexities

| Metric              | Complexity         |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Time               | O(2^n)             |
| Space              | O(target)          |

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity depends on the number of combinations we need to explore. In the worst case, it is `O(2^n)` because we explore each combination of the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space required for storing all combinations is proportional to the **target** (since combinations are constrained by the sum).

---

## üìå Summary

The **backtracking** approach efficiently explores all possible combinations that sum up to the target. By starting from each element and allowing repetition, we ensure all valid combinations are considered.

This method is commonly used in:
- **Combination sum problems**
- **Knapsack and subset sum problems**
- **Partition problems**
