# 🔍 Sliding Window Technique (Explained)

## ✅ What is Sliding Window?

The **Sliding Window Technique** is a method for solving problems involving **arrays or strings** where you're looking for **subranges (contiguous elements)** — like subarrays or substrings — that satisfy certain conditions.

Instead of using nested loops (which are often O(n²)), we maintain a **"window"** that slides over the input to reduce time complexity to **O(n)**.

## 🔄 How Sliding Window Works

- Use two pointers: `start` and `end` to define a window.
- Expand the window by moving `end`.
- Shrink the window by moving `start` when a condition is violated.
- Keep track of the result (e.g., max length, min window, total count, etc.)

## ✨ Use Cases in String Problems

Here are some common string problems solved using Sliding Window:

### 1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
- **Goal:** Find the maximum length of a substring without duplicate characters.
- **Technique:** Expand window with `end`, and if a duplicate is found, move `start` until the window is unique again.

### 2. **Minimum Window Substring**
- **Goal:** Find the smallest substring in `S` that contains all characters of `T`.
- **Technique:** Expand window until it covers `T`, then shrink from left while keeping it valid.

### 3. **Anagrams in a String**
- **Goal:** Find all anagrams of a pattern in a given string.
- **Technique:** Use a frequency map of the pattern and slide a window of the same size across the string.

### 4. **Substring with K Distinct Characters**
- **Goal:** Find longest substring with exactly K unique characters.
- **Technique:** Track character count with a HashMap and slide the window to maintain exactly K.

## 🔧 Benefits

- Reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)
- Saves memory by avoiding extra arrays/substrings
- Efficient for real-time processing (e.g., streams)

## 🧠 Example: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

```java
int start = 0, maxLength = 0;
Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();

for (int end = 0; end < s.length(); end++) {
    while (set.contains(s.charAt(end))) {
        set.remove(s.charAt(start));
        start++;
    }
    set.add(s.charAt(end));
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
}
```

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Technique          | Time     | Space    |
|--------------------|----------|----------|
| Sliding Window     | O(n)     | O(k)     |

Where `k` is the number of distinct characters in the window.

## 📚 Summary

The Sliding Window Technique is a powerful optimization for string and array problems that involve **contiguous elements**. Mastering this will drastically improve your ability to solve complex problems efficiently.
