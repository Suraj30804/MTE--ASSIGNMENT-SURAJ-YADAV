## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the maximum XOR of any two numbers from the array. The XOR operation is a bitwise operation that compares corresponding bits of two numbers and returns `1` if the bits are different and `0` if they are the same.

For example:
- `5 ^ 3 = 6`  (in binary: `0101 ^ 0011 = 0110`)
- `4 ^ 6 = 2`  (in binary: `0100 ^ 0110 = 0010`)

We need to determine the maximum XOR of any two numbers in the array.

## üß† Algorithm

### Key Insight:
The brute force approach would involve checking the XOR of all pairs, but this would take O(n^2) time, where `n` is the size of the array. We can optimize this using a **Trie (prefix tree)**.

### Optimized Approach:
1. **Trie Structure**:
   - A Trie can be used to store the binary representations of the numbers in the array.
   - For each number, we will insert its binary representation into the Trie and simultaneously calculate the maximum XOR that can be formed by XORing the current number with the previously inserted numbers.
   
2. **Trie Construction**:
   - Convert each number into its binary representation (typically 32 bits).
   - Insert the binary digits into the Trie from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
   
3. **XOR Calculation**:
   - For each new number, traverse the Trie and try to maximize the XOR by choosing the opposite bit (if possible) at each level of the Trie.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The maximum XOR obtained by any pair of numbers during the insertion process is the result.

## üíª Java Program

```java
public class MaximumXOR {

    // Trie Node
    static class TrieNode {
        TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[2];
    }

    public static int findMaximumXOR(int[] nums) {
        TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
        int maxXOR = 0;

        // Insert each number into the Trie and calculate the maximum XOR
        for (int num : nums) {
            TrieNode node = root;
            int currentXOR = 0;

            // Check each bit of the number (32-bit integer)
            for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
                int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
                
                // Check if the opposite bit exists in the Trie
                int oppositeBit = 1 - bit;

                if (node.children[oppositeBit] != null) {
                    currentXOR |= (1 << i); // Set the bit in XOR result
                    node = node.children[oppositeBit];
                } else {
                    node = node.children[bit];
                }
            }

            // Update the maximum XOR
            maxXOR = Math.max(maxXOR, currentXOR);

            // Insert the current number's binary representation into the Trie
            node = root;
            for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
                int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
                if (node.children[bit] == null) {
                    node.children[bit] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node.children[bit];
            }
        }

        return maxXOR;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8};
        System.out.println("Maximum XOR of two numbers: " + findMaximumXOR(nums));
    }
}
```

## üìå Example

### Input:
```
nums = [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]
```

### Process:

1. **Convert the numbers to binary** (32 bits):
   ```
   3  ->  00000000000000000000000000000011
   10 ->  00000000000000000000000000001010
   5  ->  00000000000000000000000000000101
   25 ->  00000000000000000000000000011001
   2  ->  00000000000000000000000000000010
   8  ->  00000000000000000000000000001000
   ```

2. **Insert these binary representations into the Trie** and calculate the maximum XOR at each step.

3. **Maximum XOR Computation**:
   - For number `25`, its XOR with previous numbers yields the maximum result.
   - The maximum XOR is `28`, which occurs from the XOR of `25` and `5` (`11001 ^ 00101 = 11100`).

### ‚úÖ Output:
```
Maximum XOR of two numbers: 28
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

| Operation            | Complexity     |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Time                 | O(n)           |
| Space                | O(n)           |

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We process each number bit by bit (32 bits, constant), so the overall time complexity is O(n).
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), since we store the binary representations of the numbers in the Trie. In the worst case, the Trie will contain up to `2 * 32 * n` nodes (32 bits per number, 2 branches per node).

## üìö Summary

The problem of finding the maximum XOR of two numbers in an array can be efficiently solved using a **Trie** data structure. By leveraging the binary representations of numbers and trying to maximize the XOR at each step, we can achieve an optimal solution with a time complexity of **O(n)** and space complexity of **O(n)**. This approach avoids the brute-force O(n^2) solution and is much more efficient for large datasets.
